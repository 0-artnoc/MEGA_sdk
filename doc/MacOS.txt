MEGA SDK configuration and compilation instructions for MacOS.
Please note, that the actual libraries versions could change in the future (to the newer ones).

*) Install Xcode and run it to accept the license agreement.

*) Install Homebrew package manager: http://brew.sh/
 The website has nice instructions how to install it. (I installed brew under Administrator user, but not sure it this is necessary).

*) Add brew path to environment variable (brew will display the instructions at the end of the installation)

*) Install dependencies:
brew install autoconf automake libtool libcryptopp sqlite openssl c-ares freeimage readline
brew reinstall --with-openssl --with-ares curl

*) Get and extract MEGA SDK sources

*) Configure project:
./configure \
 --with-openssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl \
--with-cryptopp=/usr/local/opt/cryptopp \
 --with-sqlite=/usr/local/opt/sqlite \
 --with-cares=/usr/local/opt/c-ares \
--with-curl=/usr/local/opt/curl \
--with-freeimage=/usr/local/opt/freeimage \
