# ------ building pdifum - this one needs some manual steps - these can be done before calling the script ---------------
# - Set up your Depot Tools (this can be one time, reuse it for other builds etc)
#      Follow these instructions to get the depot_tools: https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up
# - Then go to your 3rdParty/vcpkg folder, and run these commands in it to get the pdfium source:
#      #export DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0 # Keeping an old depot_tools is needed for 3710
#      export DEPOT_TOOLS=<<<<your depot_tools path>>>>
#      export PATH=$DEPOT_TOOLS;$PATH
#      mkdir pdfium
#      cd pdfium
#      gclient config --unmanaged https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git
#      gclient sync
#      # branch 3710 is compatibile with the VS 2015 compiler and v140 toolset  (or if you want to use the latest, see below)
#      cd pdfium
#      git checkout chromium/3710
#      cd ..
#      gclient sync --force
